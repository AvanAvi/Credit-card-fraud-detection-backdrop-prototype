# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository houses the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, an advanced analytical tool designed to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in credit card data. Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, this project aims to enhance security measures by accurately distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent activities.

## Getting Started

To clone and run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvanAvi/credit-card-fraud-detection-backdrop-prototype.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection-backdrop-prototype
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`
- `scipy`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project (`creditcard.csv`) contains transactions made by credit cards, where each transaction is labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. Note: The dataset is a simplified representation for educational purposes.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the dataset through histograms and correlation matrices.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming variables to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Utilizing Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor algorithms to identify outliers (fraudulent transactions).
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance through accuracy scores and classification reports.

## Usage

To run the fraud detection analysis, execute the `fraud_detection.py` script:

```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```

This will trigger the data preprocessing steps, followed by the EDA, model training, and evaluation phases, outputting the performance metrics of the models.
